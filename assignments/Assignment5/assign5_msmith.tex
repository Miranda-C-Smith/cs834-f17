\section{Problem 10.3}
 Compute five iterations of HITS (see Algorithm 3) and PageRank (see Figure 4.11) on the graph in Figure 10.3. Discuss how the PageRank scores compare to the hub and authority scores produced by HITS.

\subsection{Solution}
I calculated the HITS and page rank score by hand and with excel 103.xlsx  got the following results. I did it by hand instead of programming it or using a library so I could better understand how the formulas were working. I did not include iterations 1-3 because they are included in the book and mine are identical.

\begin{center}
Iteration 4
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 Node & Hub & Auth & PageRank \\ 
 \hline
 1 & 0.14 & 0.24 & 0.03 \\ 
 \hline
 2 &0  & 0.32 &0.05\\ 
 \hline
 3 & 0.45 &  0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
 4 &0  &  0.44&0.06\\ 
 \hline
 5 & 0.21 & 0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
 6 & 0.21 & 0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
 7 & 0 & 0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
Iteration 5
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 Node & Hub & Auth & PageRank \\ 
 \hline
 1 & 0.15 & 0.24 & 0.03 \\ 
 \hline
 2 &0  & 0.31 &0.05\\ 
 \hline
 3 & 0.45 &  0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
 4 &0  &  0.45&0.06\\ 
 \hline
 5 & 0.2 & 0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
 6 & 0.2 & 0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
 7 & 0 & 0 &0.02\\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Page Rank only needed 3 iterations to converge to a number. The numbers are a lot lower and it seems to be harser than HITS. For example Node 3 ended up with a hub score of 0.45, the highest of all 7 but its page rank is 0.02, one of the lowest. Page rank doesn't take into consideration the importance of being a hub and ranks them without consideration to a page pointing to good pages.

\section{Problem 10.5}
Find a community-based question answering site on the Web and ask two questions, one that is low-quality and one that is high-quality. Describe the answer
quality of each question.

\subsection{Solution}

I chose stackoverflow because it is theQ \& A website I am most familiar with. I chose two questions that I had come across and had difficulty solving in a different class information visualization that have value as a question and only varied the quality with which I asked the question. These questions focus on programming with d3. It is the hope that the similar post time of the question and the similar topics would make the results of the questions as similar as possible in regard to the people who might have answered and remove as much bias as possible.

\subsubsection{High quality question}
I created this question by taking two graphs in d3 to be displayed on the same page and broke it by naming the variables the same instead of renaming everything. I included all the code that I had written and highlighted the important parts and what I had tried as thoroughly as possble, but left out explicitly mentioning the few extra variables I needed to rename to fix it.
\includepdf[pages={1-}]{105highquality.pdf}

I had two people respond. The first comment came very close to fixing the issue, they only thing missing was changing the margin along with the axis. The offical answer given doesn't change what I was expecting them to but they created a JSbin shown in figure \ref{highQ} and got the code working for me and created mock data to give it since I didn't include that. They seemed to have put a lot of effort into the answer.

  \label{highQ}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Low quality question}
This question I asked in an ad hoc manner. I proveded the minimum amout of effort to get my question across but still had a valid good quality question to be asked. I chose to interpret low quality to mean the effort put into the question and not that its meaning was indecipherable. I provided no code that I had written, only linked to a page showing an example of a grouped bar chart.
\includepdf[pages={1-}]{105lowquality.pdf}

I got one answer, and it was exactly what I had wanted and provided a better answer than I had found the first time I had to solve this question. They pointed out exactly what parts of the code to change and created a working example provided in a link to exactly what I was describing shown in Figure \ref{lowQ}. The effort seems to have been the same for both questions and provided well working high quality answers.

\section{Problem 10.6}
Find two examples of document filtering systems on the Web. How do they build a profile for your information need? Is the system static or adaptive?

\subsection{Solution}

The first example is \url{https://www.pinterest.com/}.  They build a profile for me by using an account and keeping track of what I like and pin to my own boards. The system is adaptive. I have been on pinterest for years and depending on what my most recent browsing history has been, pinterest shows me pins that relate most to recent interests.

The second example is \url{https://scholar.google.com/}. When I created a profile I created a filter for myself to send emails about articles I would be interested in based off a topic I specify. When I am logged in they also show recommended articles on the search screen. This system is static. It does not update based on interaction activity. If I wanted the content to change I would need to create another filter to replace it or add on to what I'm receiving. 

\section{Problem 10.11}
Suggest how the maximum and minimum resource ranking scores, Rmax and Rmin, could be estimated for a given query.

\subsection{Solution}
To get the Rmax for a particular resource that has been returned the resources need to be reordered so that the one in question has been returned first and recalculate the statistic that was used to order the resources. The same is true for Rmin except its position need to be the last possible position and still be returned. For example if the top 10 resources are being selected out of 100 returned then the position should be 10, not 100.

\section{Problem 11.5}
How many papers dealing with term dependency can you find in the SIGIR proceedings since 2000? List their citations.

\subsection{Solution}

I queried google scholar for all papers matching the criteria "term dependency" OR "term dependent" OR "term dependence" source:SIGIR and it had to have been published in the range of 2000-2017. I got back 8 pages with 78 results. I downloaded Publish or Perish software\url{http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm} to download the results and scrape the pages for all the information I needed.
