4.1. Plot rank-frequency curves (using a log-log graph) for words and bigrams in
the Wikipedia collection available through the book website (http://www.searchengines-
book.com). Plot a curve for the combination of the two. What are the best
values for the parameter c for each curve?

4.2. Plot vocabulary growth for the Wikipedia collection and estimate the parameters
for Heaps’ law. Should the order in which the documents are processed
make any difference?

4.3. Try to estimate the number of web pages indexed by two different search engines
using the technique described in this chapter. Compare the size estimates
from a range of queries and discuss the consistency (or lack of it) of these estimates.

4.6. Process five Wikipedia documents using the Porter stemmer and the Krovetz
stemmer. Compare the number of stems produced and find 10 examples of differences
in the stemming that could have an impact on ranking.

4.7. Use the GATE POS tagger to tag a Wikipedia document. Define a rule or
rules to identify phrases and show the top 10 most frequent phrases. Now use the
POS tagger on the Wikipedia queries. Are there any problems with the phrases
identified?

4.8. Find the 10 Wikipedia documents with the most inlinks. Show the collection
of anchor text for those pages.

4.9. Compute PageRank for the Wikipedia documents. List the 20 documents
with the highest PageRank values together with the values.

5.8. Write a program that can build a simple inverted index of a set of text documents.
Each inverted list will contain the file names of the documents that contain
that word.
Suppose the file A contains the text “the quick brown fox”, and file B contains
“the slow blue fox”. The output of your program would be:
% ./your-program A B
blue B
brown A
fox A B
quick A
slow B
the A B

5.10. Suppose a company develops a new unambiguous lossless compression
scheme for 2-bit numbers called SuperShrink. Its developers claim that it will reduce
the size of any sequence of 2-bit numbers by at least 1 bit. Prove that the
developers are lying. More specifically, prove that either:
• SuperShrink never uses less space than an uncompressed encoding, or
• There is an input to SuperShrink such that the compressed version is larger
than the uncompressed input
You can assume that each 2-bit input number is encoded separately.


5.14. In section 5.7.3, we saw that the optimal skip distance c can be determined
by minimizing the quantity kn/c + pc/2, where k is the skip pointer length, n
is the total inverted list size, c is the skip interval, and p is the number of postings
to find.
Plot this function using k = 4, n = 1,000,000, and p = 1,000, but varying c.
Then, plot the same function, but set p = 10,000. Notice how the optimal value
for c changes.
Finally, take the derivative of the function kn/c + pc/2 in terms of c to find
the optimum value for c for a given set of other parameters (k, n, and p).

5.16. Write the program described in Exercise 5.15 using the Galago search toolkit.
Verify that it works by indexing the Wikipedia collection provided on the book
website.
